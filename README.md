## About Me

I currently work at the Census Bureau, where I build machine learning and data science pipelines for analyzing User-generated feedback. 

I graduated from UCSD with a B.S. in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation. In college I focused mostly on Natural Language Processing techniques.
